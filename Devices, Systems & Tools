Function and operation of selected devices, systems and tools used in all project phases 1, 2 and 3 

Phase 1: Development

1. VirtualBox: Virtualisation software to run our virtual machines (VMs) on our host computers. It enabled the setup and configuration of different operating systems and environments required for the project.

2. OPNsense Firewall: An open-source firewall and routing platform to act as our prototype firewall in the project, providing network segmentation, traffic inspection, and logging capabilities.

3. Palo Alto Firewall: We utilised the next-generation firewall for advanced security features such as application visibility and control, user identification, and threat prevention. It served as the production firewall in the project.

4. Kali Purple: Used for our security operation center (SOC) use cases. It is used as the SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) platform, hosting the Elastic Stack and Fleet Server.

5. Elastic Stack: Our open-source tools for data ingestion, search, analysis, and visualisation. It includes Elasticsearch (for data indexing and search), Kibana (for data visualisation and dashboards), and other components for log management and security analytics.

6. Fleet Server: A component of the Elastic Stack that centrally manages and communicates with Elastic Agents, enabling the deployment of security agents and policies across multiple hosts (DMZ, client PC and Windows server).

Phase 2: Execution

1. Elastic Defend: Integrated within the Elastic Stack and provided endpoint security capabilities, such as malware prevention, ransomware protection, and memory threat detection (enabled default malware protections).

2. Windows Server 2022: Our server operating system used to set up an Active Directory domain environment, providing centralised management of user accounts, group policies, and domain services.

3. Wireshark: Used for network protocol identification and capturing and analysing network traffic, helping to verify connectivity, log collection and ingestion into the Elastic Stack.

Throughout the second phase, additional tools and utilities were used for tasks like remote management (SSH, RDP), firewall configuration and log analysis.

Phase 3: Evaluation

1. Elastic Security: Utilised the component of Elastic Stack that provides security analytics, threat detection, and response capabilities. It includes security rules, alerts, and visualisation tools for investigating incidents.

2. Security Testing Tools: Kali Purple tools and techniques were used for security testing and evaluation, such as vulnerability scanners (Nmap, Nikto), penetration testing tools, or simulated attack scenarios to assess the detection and response capabilities of the implemented security controls.

Phase 2: Tools Implementation -  
Virtualisation and virtual network interconnection configuration  
Firewall installation and configuration 
IDS/IPS implementation (Palo Alto Security profiles) 
SIEM (KaliPurple) Elastic security implementation 
Endpoint protection and Endpoint agent installation and configuration 
Client PC Wireshark installation 


Virtualisation and virtual network interconnection configuration: 
Set up virtual machines for different components like Windows clients, Windows Server, DMZ web server, and Kali Purple using VirtualBox. 
Configured virtual networks like NAT, bridged, internal, and host-only adapters to interconnect these VMs with the physical network and firewalls (OPNsense and Palo Alto).

Firewall installation and configuration:
Installed the OPNsense firewall as a prototype in VirtualBox, configuring interfaces, zones, and firewall rules for network segmentation and traffic inspection.
For the production environment, we deployed the Palo Alto Firewall appliance, configured interfaces, security policies, NAT rules, and log forwarding profiles.

IDS/IPS implementation (Palo Alto Security profiles): 
For intrusion detection and prevention, we leveraged the security profiles in the Palo Alto Firewall, which provided application visibility, user identification, and threat prevention capabilities.

SIEM (Kali Purple) Elastic security implementation:
Installed Kali Purple as the SIEM platform and configured the Elastic Stack components, including Elasticsearch for indexing and search, Kibana for data visualisation, and Fleet Server for managing Elastic Agents. We implemented Elastic Security for security analytics, threat detection and response.

Endpoint protection and Endpoint agent installation and configuration:  
Integrated the Elastic Defend module into the Elastic Stack and added it to the Fleet Server policy. 
Installed Elastic Defend agents on Windows clients and the DMZ web server to provide endpoint security capabilities like malware prevention, ransomware protection, and memory threat detection.

Client PC Wireshark installation: 
Installed Wireshark on client PC, DMZ, the host system (for bridged network adapters) to capture and analyse network traffic, check connectivity and verify log collection and ingestion into the Elastic Stack on Kali Purple.
