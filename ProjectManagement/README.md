### Project Overview

The project involves the implementation of a Cyber Security Operations Center (CSOC) for small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). It includes the development, execution, evaluation, and documentation of a prototype cybersecurity model (CSOC). This infrastructure will consist of both physical and virtualized firewalls, servers, clients, and a SIEM system. The project will also conduct and document Red and Blue (Purple) teaming activities to ensure robust cybersecurity measures.

**Business Problem Definition**

SMEs are increasingly targeted by cyber threats due to their relatively weaker security infrastructures compared to larger organizations. The primary issues faced by SMEs include:

- Insufficient security measures to protect sensitive data.
  
- Lack of real-time monitoring and incident response capabilities.
  
- Inadequate resources for comprehensive security infrastructure implementation.
  

This project aims to address these issues by developing a prototype CSOC that provides comprehensive security measures, real-time monitoring, and effective incident response capabilities.

**Scope Clarification**

- What specific business outcomes are expected from implementing the CSOC infrastructure?
  
- Are there any budgetary constraints or limitations associated with this project?
  
- What is the expected timeline for each phase of the project?
  

**Team Members**

- Nick Woolcock - Network Specialist
  
- Shehreen Haider  - Security Analyst
  
- Jarna Salonen - System Administrator (Team Leader)
  

**Technical Requirements**

- What specific compliance standards or regulations must the CSOC adhere to?
  
- How many endpoints are expected to be monitored by the SIEM system?
  
- Are there any preferred tools or software versions required for the project?
  

**Resource Allocation**

- What are the specific roles and responsibilities of each team member?
  
- Who will be responsible for maintaining and monitoring the CSOC after implementation?
  

**Testing and Evaluation**

- What criteria determine the success of the exercises involving the Red and Blue teams?
  
- What methods will be used to measure and assess the performance of the CSOC infrastructure?

| --- | --- |
| This project will NOT accomplish or include the following: | - The project will not ensure any physical security measures like access control systems, CCTV surveillance, etc. <br>- It will not Integrate with any additional systems or services that are not explicitly mentioned in the project requirements.<br>- It will not provide any comprehensive cybersecurity training for employees.<br>- Disaster recovery and business continuity planning will not be included in this project.<br>- It will not ensure compliance with specific regulations or standards beyond what is explicitly mentioned in the project requirements. |

## Step 4. Project Assumptions:
  

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| NO. | ASSUMPTION |
| 1   | It is assumed that all the necessary hardware and software resources (like PaloAlto firewall, Cisco Switch, KaliPurple SIEM, Windows server 22, Elastic Defend, etc.) are available and functional. If this assumption proves false, it could lead to delays in project execution and increased costs. |
| 2   | The project assumes that there will be effective communication among all project team members and stakeholders. Poor communication could lead to misunderstandings, conflicts, and delays in project execution. |
| 3   | All team members will turn up regularly. Failure to do so will impact the project schedule and cohesion. |
